# Power BI Service – Collaboration and Distribution

You have built the dashboard and ready to get feedback and collaborate with your team members.

1. From the left panel, select Workspaces.
2. Select the ellipsis next to DIAD\_<youremailaddress>.
3. Select Workspace access.
4. Access dialog opens. You can enter the email addresses of the colleagues you want to collaborate with. Each user can belong to one of 3 roles:

   - Contributor Add/edit/delete content within workspace.
   - Member Everything a Contributor can do. Re-share. Publish & update Apps.
   - Admin Everything a member can do. Can change/delete workspace. Can add Admins.

5. Select the role and select Add.
6. Once you finish adding your colleagues and select Close.

**Note:** you can ask your colleague to login and access the workspace.

Now let’s share the content we created with the report viewers/consumers. We need to publish an app to do this. An App can include multiple dashboards and reports.

7. In the left panel select DIAD\_<youremailaddress> workspace.
8. In the Dashboard page, notice there is an option INCLUDED IN APP, to include the Dashboard in the App.
9. Navigate to Reports page.
10. Notice there is an option INCLUDED IN APP to include the Reports in the App. If you have reports and dashboards in your workspace that you do not want to share with report viewers, you can uncheck this box. In our case we would like to include the 2 reports, so we will leave the boxes checked.
11. In the left panel select DIAD\_<youremailaddress> workspace.
12. From the top right corner of the top menu select Publish app.
13. In the Setup page, enter “This is DIAD app” in the description field.
14. Click on Navigation page.
15. From the dropdown select VanArsdel (dashboard). When a user accesses the DIAD app, we want them to land on the VanArsdel dashboard.
16. Navigate to Permissions page.
17. Enter the email addresses of the users or groups you want to give access to.
18. On the bottom right corner, select Publish App.
19. Ready to publish dialog appears. Select Publish.
20. Once the App is published a success dialog appears.

You can copy the link to the App and share it with the individuals via email. But a better way for report viewers to consume the App is by logging onto Power BI Service and registering the App. Let’s impersonate a report viewer.

21. From the left menu, select Apps.
22. Select Get Apps.
23. AppSource dialog opens. You will notice DIAD\_<youremailaddress> App listed. Select Get it now.

This is a one-time registration. Going forward when you select Apps in the left panel, you will see DIAD\_<youremailaddress> app in the list of Apps you have registered.

24. Click on DIAD\_<youremailaddress> tile. You will be navigated to VanArsdel dashboard.
